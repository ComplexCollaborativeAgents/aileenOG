1. Ensure you have an account on dubs that you can ssh to without a password

2. Clone the repo somewhere in your home directory

3. Setup configuration file
In agent/config.json there is now the following section
  "ConceptLearner":{
    "hostname": "dubs",
    "port": 8080,
    "learner_path": "/home/klenk/code/AILEEN/aileen-agent/agent/concept_learner"
  }

  Update the port to a new one (to avoid collisions with CI and other users), and update learner_path to your directory

4. pytests tests.test_concept_learner should now work.

# Troubleshooting

## AnalogyStack
Look at the wiki for helpful commands.

One thing that I considered doing was ensuring that we had a fresh knowledge base everytime. You can see that in launch script I wanted to include an optional argument to overwrite the kb each time. Now we can do it manually if necessary.

## Logs
In the learner_path directory, there is a concept.log file that takes stdout from the allegroserve. This is useful for tracking things down.

## Automated lisp testing
When developing on the server side it is best to write and run tests in lisp.
/usr/local/acl10.1.64/mlisp8 -batch -L testgeneralization.lsp -e "(aileen::run-tests)" -kill
